\_This post is a summary of Kevin Hale's talk to founders at YC School. You can find the original talk [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6q-how-to-pitch-your-startup).

- You are designing slides that democratize the idea. Legible ideas can be understood by someone who knows nothing about your business. It's very important to be able to explain your companies purpose quickly and easily.

# Don't

- **Ambiguity** Users and investors need to be able to understand your business in one sentence, without having to ask questions.

- **Complexity** Your idea needs to be simple enough to communicate it to anyone. Avoid difficult language.

- **Ignorable** Avoid marketing speak, buzzwords and other ignorable language. People switch off when they hear words that don't add understanding of the product to the sentence.

_Example: "We create AI solutions that revolutionise the way the world communicates." => "Our mobile application allows teams to communicate remotely."_

# Do

- Be Conversational: A really good pitch is one that your mum understands. Don't use jargon to make the product sound complex. It distances you from the people you are talking to. Go straight to the point, no preample.
- Be Reproducible: Investors need to be able to construct a mental image of your product and how people will use it in their heads. Use lots of nouns and less adjectives so that they can build a concrete image of what your company can do. The three most important nouns are:

  - 1.  What are you making?
  - 2.  What is the problem?
  - 3.  Who is the customer?

- Examples: "We are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information". This is bad, I do not know the answer to any of the three questions. AirBnB: Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals instead of hotels. Clear, conscise, reproducible. Dropbox: "Synchronizes files across yours or your teams computers". Understandable, reproducible.

- The "X for Y" is very useful since it allows you to avoid explaining the complexity of a business model and replace it with X. It has to be used correctly however. Should I use X for Y?

  - X should be a household name. Everyone should agree that X is successful.
  - Does Y want X? How clear is it that the target wants the innovation model of X?
  - Y should be a large market. If you are building X in a smaller market Y, that is a bad investment proposition.

  Bad examples: Buffer for Snapchat. Buffer is a much smaller company then Snapchat.

Summary: Lead with what. Not with why or how. Have empathy for the investors that are looking at hundreds of applications.
